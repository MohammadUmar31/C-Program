You are given a real number a and an integer b (b > 0), and your task is to write a recursive function that calculates a raised to the power of b (i.e., a^b).

double recursivePower(double a, int b) {
        if(b==1) return a;
        else{
            return a * recursivePower(a,b-1);
        }
}
