You are given an array arr of size n and two indices left and right. 
Your task is to write a recursive function that reverses the elements between the indices left and right (inclusive) while leaving the rest of the array unchanged.

void reverseArraySection(vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {
        if(left>=right) return;
        swap(arr[left],arr[right]);
        left++;
        right--;
        reverseArraySection(arr,left,right);
}
